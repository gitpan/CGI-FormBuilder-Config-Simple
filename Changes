	->validate_fieldset() and ->validate_field, as well as
	a hook for processing custom_validation_methods defined
	in the configuration file and in the user's module.
	Also have made a thorough review of the perldoc,
	bringing it up to speed with the state of this
	module's development.  Also have crushed a potential
	SQL-injection bug introduced since preceeding version.
